    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="links-and-images/images/dancing.jpeg" alt="Dancing" style="width:20%;height:20%;">
    <p> I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee before moving to Columbus for college in 2011. I received my 
        BFA in Dance from The Ohio State University in 2013. I enjoyed the moments we spent learning
        how to navigate Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and GarageBand, but my true skills I gained during my time in college
        include adaptability, improvisation, and collaboration. I am transitioning into a Software Development 
        role after completing We Can Code IT Bootcamp. Hands-on project experience 
        building both the front-end and back-end of web apps.
